What happens when you initialise a repository? Why do you need
to do it?

Git takes a snapshot of the current files. You need to do it so
you can start using Git

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is a middle between the two so you can make sure you want to commit before you do.
