When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

One reason is that you would be working on the project on several computers, for example if you
hotdesk or have a laptop for when you are out. Also if you are working with other people
you can use a remote repository so everyone can access it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might not want the changes on the remote repository 

Describe the differences between forks,clone and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is when you want to clone someones repository and yours to be linked back to theirs so you can feedback your changes.
A clone is just a simple copy of a repository it can be local or from github.
A branch is when you want to achieve something different or experiment with the code but still have a master branch that you can rely on.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

The benefit is that you store a copy without commiting to it straight away if you are not going to have access to the internet.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

You would have to notify the leader of any changes and then he would have to implement them. It would be easier to work on the changes but it would be harder to merge them into the master file.
